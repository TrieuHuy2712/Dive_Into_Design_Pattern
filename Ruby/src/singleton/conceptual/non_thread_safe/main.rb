# Singleton Design Pattern
#
# Intent: Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a
# global access point to this instance.

# The Singleton class defines the `instance` method that lets clients access the
# unique singleton instance.
class Singleton
  @instance = new

  private_class_method :new

  # The static method that controls the access to the singleton instance.
  #
  # This implementation let you subclass the Singleton class while keeping just
  # one instance of each subclass around.
  def self.instance
    @instance
  end

  # Finally, any singleton should define some business logic, which can be
  # executed on its instance.
  def some_business_logic
    # ...
  end
end

# The client code.

s1 = Singleton.instance
s2 = Singleton.instance

if s1.equal?(s2)
  print 'Singleton works, both variables contain the same instance.'
else
  print 'Singleton failed, variables contain different instances.'
end
